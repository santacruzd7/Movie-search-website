# Movie-search-website
Implementation of a simple movie-search website that uses the database of Rotten Tomatoes to look for movies that match your search as well as the database of Google Books to suggest a book on which each movie result might be based (if any).
The technologies used are: HTML, CSS (material design), Javascript (with AJAX).
Project for the "Middleware for Networked and Distributed Systems" graduate course at the University of California, Irvine (USA).
